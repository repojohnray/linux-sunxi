General Touchscreen Softbutton Properties:

Some touchscreens extend over the display they cover and have a number
of capacative softbuttons outside of the display the cover.

Some of these softbuttons simply report touches with coordinates outside of
the normal coordinate space for touches on the display. This binding is for
describing such buttons in devicetree.

Each softkey is represented as a sub-node of the touchscreen node.

Required subnode-properties:
 - label			: Descriptive name of the key.
 - linux,code			: Keycode to emit.
 - softbutton-min-x		: X start of the area the softbutton area covers
 - softbutton-max-x		: X end of the area the softbutton area covers
 - softbutton-min-y		: Y start of the area the softbutton area covers
 - softbutton-max-y		: Y end of the area the softbutton area covers

Optional subnode-properties:
- linux,led-trigger		: String for a LED trigger for providing visual
				  feedback that the softbutton has been pressed

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/input/input.h>

&i2c2 {
	ft5406ee8: touchscreen@38 {
		compatible = "edt,edt-ft5406";
		reg = <0x38>;
		touchscreen-size-x = <1024>;
		touchscreen-size-y = <768>;

		button@0 {
			label = "Esc";
			linux,code = <KEY_ESC>;
			softbutton-min-x = <1084>;
			softbutton-max-x = <1098>;
			softbutton-min-y = <0>;
			softbutton-max-y = <49>;
		};

		button@1 {
			label = "Home";
			linux,code = <KEY_HOMEPAGE>;
			softbutton-min-x = <1084>;
			softbutton-max-x = <1098>;
			softbutton-min-y = <50>;
			softbutton-max-y = <99>;
		};

		button@2 {
			label = "Menu";
			linux,code = <KEY_MENU>;
			softbutton-min-x = <1084>;
			softbutton-max-x = <1098>;
			softbutton-min-y = <100>;
			softbutton-max-y = <149>;
		};
	};
};
